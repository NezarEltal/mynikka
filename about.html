        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        
        <p style="width:90vw; margin:auto; text-align:center;">We are a conglomerate of many like-minded individuals. Two are married, one is a bum in college, and the other is the head of an 
        illustrious MSA looking for a spouse (but in the most
        halal way, mashAllah, mashAllah). We're pretty smart and know pretty much everything
        there is to know of marriage, so, you know, use this site wisely cause it's cool.</p>
        
        <h1>Ok, but why did you even make this?</h1>
        
        <p style="width:90vw; margin:auto; text-align:center;">It's kinda tough these days to find yourself a place that has 
        ALL the info you need on every step in this 
        process, and we needed some sadaqah jariyah. These two needs came together to become something beautiful.</p>
